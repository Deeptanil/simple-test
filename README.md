**SIMPLIFIED TESTS**


This is my first project. I was giving mock tests and considered making it (procatination) and it seems to work really well.

This is a python run program using csv files. It takes user inputs (answers) and stores them in a (.csv) file. Then using an exisiting answer key file it checks the answers and shows all mistakes and gives a total marks.



**Functions:**
1. Record answers given by user.

3. Edit mistakes done by user.

5. Review the test.
